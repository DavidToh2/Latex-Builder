# Documentation for the Latex Builder Server

This document serves to detail the features developed for the Latex Builder server.

# Authentication and Login Systems

The following cookies will be stored in the user's session storage:
```
Session ID: [generated by express-session]
User ID: [sent by server upon login]
```
Session data is stored in the server's SessionStore in this format. The session ID is hashed using the secret in our `.env` folder.
```
{ User ID, Encrypted Session ID }
```
We can access the SessionStore simply by invoking `req.session`. This will fetch our user's session ID (stored in the user's session data), check it against our SessionStore, then (if present) fetch all other session data.

Whenever a user makes a session-dependent request, we check whether their session ID is present in the SessionStore simply by accessing `req.session.uID`.

# Scripting Latex

Drive. To implement ability to:
- upload .tex and .pdf files
- view .pdf files
- remove files

Latex compiler. To implement ability to:
- collate build into a .tex file, and:
  - export as .tex file
  - compile into .pdf, then export as .pdf. The file will not be saved
  - compile into .pdf, then save both .tex and .pdf in drive
